Charitable giving can accelerate the adoption of crypto and make it a force for good in the world. We believe that blockchain technology can increase transparency, lower overhead costs and involve a wider audience in the effort to make the world a better place.

Early estimates place global charitable giving at approximately $600 Billion** **in 2020. $450 billion was donated to charities in the United States in 2019 alone. Out of the $450 billion, individuals donated a total of $309 billion (69% share), foundations $75 billion (17%), bequests $43 billion (10%) & corporations $21 billion (5%). The majority of charitable dollars went to religion (29%), education (14%), human services (12%), grantmaking foundations (12%), and health (9%). Giving in 2019 increased in nearly every sector, with double-digit growth in gifts for education (12.1%); public-society benefit (13.1%); arts, culture, and humanities (12.6%); and environment and animal organizations (11.3%).

Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, famously donated 50 trillion Shiba Inu tokens (then worth $1.2 Billion) to India's Crypto Covid Relief Fund.  He also donated $50 million worth of ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency behind BTC, to [GiveWell](https://www.devex.com/organizations/givewell-43945), which supports charities with proven evidence of impact.
