# Roadmap

The long-term vision of the iHelp protocol is to be the leading ecosystem of DeFi tools that will **** connect charitable causes around the globe with capital contributors. In the short run we plan to support more ERC-20 tokens for deposit, integrate additional lending pools, and deploy the protocol in other EVM compatible L1s and L2s.
