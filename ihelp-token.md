# HELP Token

Helpers that deposit capital into charitable interest pools will receive HELP reward tokens as their capital generates interest for charities. While contributing to a cause is a noble and meaningful reward by itself, we seek to create a robust and sustainable ecosystem with specific key incentives and programmed allocation of resources that will help the protocol become a thriving ecosystem with a global community of supporters.&#x20;

The HELP token's purpose will be to create reward mechanisms that incentivize people to use the protocol and contribute to its long-term sustainability.
