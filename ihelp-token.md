# IHELP Token

Helpers that deposit capital into charitable interest pools will receive IHELP reward tokens as their capital generates interest for charities. While contributing to a cause is a noble and meaningful reward by itself, we seek to create a robust and sustainable ecosystem with specific key incentives and programmed allocation of resources that will be needed to disrupt the legacy philanthropy space.&#x20;

The IHELP token's purpose will be to create reward mechanisms that incentivize people to use the protocol and contribute to its long-term sustainability.
