On-Chain Functionality

Add/Remove Capital to Donate Yield: Donors will be able to browse a list of charities and select which ones will receive a token allocation. The donor then selects the underlying token and lending protocol from the menu of available options; the donor can add or remove capital at will. Once the donor deposits the tokens, 80% of the generated yield is donated to their selected charity. The remaining 20% is allocated between the staking pool and protocol fees. Depositing capital for yield donation purposes accrues IHELP token rewards, while direct donations do not. Donors will earn IHELP tokens based on the total yield they have generated and the current token distribution phase.

##

Direct Donations**:** The protocol allows donors to contribute tokens directly to charities. Direct donations do not accrue IHELP token rewards. Like traditional donations, once a donor selects the charity and makes the contribution, the donation is final.&#x20;
