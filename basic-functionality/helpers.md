# Helpers

On-Chain Functionality

Add/Remove Capital to Donate Interest: This is the core initial feature of the protocol. Helpers will be able to see a list of Charities and select the amount of capital they want to supply. This capital will be deposited in a blue-chip lending protocol, such as Aave or Compound, and can be removed at any time. 80% of the interest generated by their capital will be donated to their selected charity. The remaining 20% will be allocated between the staking pool and protocol fees. Helpers will earn IHELP tokens based on the total amount of interest they have generated and the current token distribution phase. &#x20;

Stake/Unstake IHELP Tokens:** **IHELP token holders will be able to stake their tokens in exchange for their pro-rata share of the funds that have flowed into the Staking Rewards wallet. IHELP token holders will be able to view the accrual total and claim it at their convenience. Helpers will be able to withdraw their staked tokens at any time. \
