# Charities

**On-Chain Functionality**

Claim Donations**:** A charity will be able to connect their custody account to the protocol via an OAuth in order for the protocol to distribute their donated proceeds. Charities will be able to choose whether to keep their donated proceeds in crypto or auto-convert to USD.&#x20;

Withdraw from Protocol: **** A charity will be able to remove itself from the protocol at any time. The charity will technically move itself to an archived status, and any accrued donations up until that point will be distributed to their custody account.\

**Off-Chain Functionality**

Request to Join Protocol**:** Charities can request to join the protocol by filling out the sign-up form on the iHelp website. The iHelp DAO will be responsible for vetting charities and deciding on accepting or rejecting the sign up request. The proposal will include all the minimum required information to review the charity and to list on protocol.&#x20;

Edit/Update Profile: **** Charities will be able to edit/update their profile information on the protocol to ensure the most relevant information is being presented to Helpers. We want to promote a social environment where charities keep Helpers engaged on the uses of their donations.
