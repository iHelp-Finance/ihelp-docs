# Charities

**On-Chain Functionality**

Claim Donations**:** A charity will be able to connect their wallet and see their total accrued donations. Charities will be able to claim their donations at any time. Charities that have been archived will be able to claim their donations at any time as well. Donations will be available for withdrawal indefinitely.&#x20;

Withdraw from Protocol: **** A charity will be able to remove itself from the protocol at any time. The charity will technically move itself to an archived status, where any unclaimed rewards will still be available for withdrawal. \

**Off-Chain Functionality**

Request to Join Protocol**:** Charities can propose to join the protocol. The iHelp DAO will be responsible for accepting or rejecting the proposal. The proposal will include all the minimum required information to review the charity and to list on protocol.&#x20;

Edit/Update Profile: **** Charities will be able to edit/update their profile information on the protocol to ensure the most relevant information is being presented to Helpers. We want to promote a social environment where charities keep Helpers engaged on the uses of their donations.
