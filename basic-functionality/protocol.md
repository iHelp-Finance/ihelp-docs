# Protocol

Add/Archive Charities: The protocol cannot function without Charities. The iHelp DAO will delegate to staffers the ability to add, edit and archive charities via vote from the gHELP token holders. The required inputs to add a charity at a minimum will be: Charity Wallet Address, Name, URL, and Brief Description. Charities will eventually be able to self-on board onto the protocol, with the iHelp DAO reserving the right to archive any charities to protect it from bad actors.â€Œ

Upgrade Certain Protocol Contracts: **\[some contracts are upgradeable and some are not. We can list them. We can also explain why we are taking this approach].**
