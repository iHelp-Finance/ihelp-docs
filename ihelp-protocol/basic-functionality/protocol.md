# Protocol

Add/Archive Charities: The protocol cannot function without charities. The iHelp DAO will have the ability to add, edit and archive charities via vote from the multisig. The required inputs to add a charity at are listed on the charity sign up form. Charities will eventually be able to self-on board onto the protocol, with the iHelp DAO reserving the right to archive any charities to protect it from bad actors.â€Œ

Upgrade Protocol Contracts: **** The iHelp DAO has the power to upgrade certain protocol contracts to ensure the safety of the protocol. Some contracts are non-upgradeable.
