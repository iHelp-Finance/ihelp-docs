# Distribution Phases

There will be 20 distinct phases of 1,000,000 IHELP tokens each, for a total of 20,000,000 IHELP tokens to be distributed to Helpers. Within each individual phase the amount of tokens received per each dollar of interest donated will be the same for all Helpers. The iHelp protocol will track the total sum of interest donated to all Charities, measured in USD by a Chainlink Oracle. The total interest donated (_phase size_) will double in each successive phase, while the amount of tokens distributed per phase will remain fixed at 1,000,000 IHELP per phase. The formula to calculate the Interest Donated for any phase is:
