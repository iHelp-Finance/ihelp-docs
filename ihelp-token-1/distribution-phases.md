# Distribution Phases

There will be 13 distinct phases of 1,000,000 IHELP tokens each, for a total of 13,000,000 IHELP tokens to be distributed to Helpers as a reward for contributing capital to the protocol.&#x20;

As you can see below, the amount of interest required to receive one IHELP token increases by 2x in each phase. In Phase 1 users will receive one IHELP token for every $0.60 of interest donated to charities. In Phase 2, the number doubles to $1.20 required interest donated to receive one IHELP token.&#x20;

The iHelp protocol will track the total sum of interest donated to all Charities, measured in USD employing a Chainlink Oracle. Based on the schedule below, a cummulative $5BB worth of interest has to be donated in order for 100% of the community rewards to be distributed.

Below you will find the detail on every phase at the protocol's launch. The community will be able to accelerate or slow down the emissions rate of user rewards/incentives via a governance vote. The total number of tokens to distribute via rewards is fixed and cannot be modified.&#x20;
