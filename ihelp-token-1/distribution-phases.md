# Distribution Phases

There will be 13 distinct phases of 1,000,000 HELP tokens each, for a total of 13,000,000 HELP tokens to be distributed to Helpers as a reward for contributing capital to the protocol.&#x20;

The amount of interest required to receive one HELP token increases by 2x in each phase (see table below). In Phase 1 users will receive one HELP token for every $0.60 of interest donated to charities. In Phase 2, the number doubles to $1.20 required interest donated to receive one HELP token.&#x20;

The IHelp protocol will track the total sum of interest donated to all charities measured in USD employing a Chainlink Oracle.

Below you will find the detail on every phase at the protocol's launch. The community will be able to accelerate or slow down the emissions rate of user rewards/incentives via a governance vote. The total number of tokens to distribute via rewards is fixed and cannot be modified.&#x20;
