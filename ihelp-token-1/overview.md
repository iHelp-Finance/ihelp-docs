# Allocations

The HELP tokenâ€™s purpose will be to **** incentivize Helpers to use the platform, as well as contribute to the long-term success of the network.&#x20;

The HELP token will be a fixed-supply ERC-20 token. Supply will be capped at 27,000,000 IHELP tokens.&#x20;

**14,000,000 IHELP (51.9%)**: Will be pre-mined and distriuted to the iHelp DAO. These tokens will be used for fundraising, protocol improvement grants, CEX/DEX liquidity, advisors & founders, as well as a long term reserve for the IHELP DAO. The pre-mined tokens will remain in the IHELP DAO treasury until details are provided on how the tokens will be allocated.&#x20;

**13,000,000 IHELP (48.1%)**: Will be distributed as an incentive/reward to whomever donates interest through the protoocol. The token award calculation will be based on the amount of interest donated by the Helper(s). The token award ratio is split into 13 phases based on the amount of interest generated, with specific step downs. Please refer to the [Distribution Phases](distribution-phases.md) section to learn more. The total amount of tokens to distribute to the community as rewards cannot be changed via governance. However, the rate at which tokens are distributed to users as an incentive/reward can be modified via a governance vote.&#x20;
