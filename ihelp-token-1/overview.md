**20,000,000 IHELP (74%)**: Will be distributed to Helpers that use the iHelp protocol and contribute their capital towards interest donations. The token award calculation will be based on the amount of interest donated by the Helper(s). The token award ratio is split into 20 phases based on the amount of interest generated, with specific step downs. The more interest the platform cumulatively generates over time, the smaller the amount of tokens awarded per $ in interest that is donated by Helpers

**7,000,000 IHELP (26%)**: Will be pre-mined by the iHelp DAO and used to raise capital for development, marketing, and incentive funds in order to establish and grow the iHelp protocol.
