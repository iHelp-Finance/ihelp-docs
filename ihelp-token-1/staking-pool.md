# Staking Pool

### Claim your share of platform revenues

For every donation processed via IHELP, **** a portion  is set aside and accrued by the protocol to be distributed to the staking pool. The accrued staking allocation is periodically converted into a stablecoin and then distributed to the XHELP pool.&#x20;

The percentage distributed to the staking pool is as follows:&#x20;

* Yield donations - 15% of yield donated
* Direct donations - 2.5% of capital donated&#x20;
