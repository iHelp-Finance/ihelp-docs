# Donation Distribution

**Yield Donations**

Yield donations are distributed in the following manner:

* **80% to IHELP Foundation:** The IHELP Foundation receives and promptly processes the donation by converting it to fiat and forwarding the donation to the charitable cause.
* **10% Staking Rewards:** These rewards will be claimable by token holders that stake their HELP tokens. This is the main mechanism to incentivize use of the protocol outside of the core reward of providing assistance to a worthwhile charitable cause.
* **10% IHELP Protocol Development:** Will be distributed to the IHELP DAO treasury.
