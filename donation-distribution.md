# Donation Distribution

For any given amount of interest generated by a Helperâ€™s capital, the interest shall be allocated in the following manner:

* **80% to Charity Wallets:** Charities will be able to see their total accrued donations and claim them at any time.&#x20;
* **15% Staking Rewards:** These rewards will be claimable by token holders that stake their IHELP tokens in the staking pool. This is the main mechanism to incentivize use of the protocol outside of the core reward of providing assistance to a worthwhile philanthropic cause
* **5% iHelp Protocol Development:** Will be claimable by the iHelp DAO wallet to support maintenance and development expenses.

For any given amount of principal that is directly donated by a Helper to a Charity, the principal shall be allocated in the following manner:

* **95% to Charity Wallets:** Charities will be able to see their total accrued donations and claim them at any time.&#x20;
* **2.5% Staking Rewards**: These rewards will be claimable by token holders that stake their IHELP tokens in the staking pool. This is the main mechanism to incentivize use of the protocol outside of the core reward of providing assistance to a worthwhile philanthropic cause.
* **2.5% iHelp Protocol Development:** Will be claimable by the iHelp DAO wallet to support maintenance and development expenses.
