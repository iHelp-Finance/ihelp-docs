# Leaderboard

IHELP has a leaderboard module that ranks donors and charities. Donors rank anonymously or by a nickname of their choosing.\


There are separate leaderboards for yield donations and direct donations. The leaderboard keeps track of all contributions from protocol inception and allows anyone to see different data sets, such as:

* Top Yield Donors - Since Inception / Last 30 Days
* Top Direct Donors - Since Inception / Last 30 Days
* Top Charities -  Donations Received Since Inception / Last 30 Days
* Top Charities - By Current TVL
* Top Donors - By Current TVL

The leaderboard seeks to recognize the most generous donors within the IHELP community as well as highlighting the most active charities within our ecosystem. The leaderboard will evolve and include more features in the near future. \
