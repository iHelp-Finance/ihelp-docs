# Leaderboard

IHelp will have a leaderboard module that will rank Helpers and charities. Helpers will be ranked anonymously or by a nickname of their choosing.\


There will be separate leaderboards for yield donations and direct donations. The leaderboard will keep track of all contributions from protocol inception, and allow anyone to see different specific data sets, such as:

* Top No Principal Loss Helpers - Since Inception / Last 30 Days
* Top Direct Helpers - Since Inception / Last 30 Days
* Top Charities -  Donations Received Since Inception / Last 30 Days
* Top Charities - By Current TVL
* Top Helpers - By Current TVL

The leaderboard seeks to recognize the most generous Helpers within the IHelp community as well as highlighting the most active charities within our ecosystem. The leaderboard will evolve and include more features in the near future. \
