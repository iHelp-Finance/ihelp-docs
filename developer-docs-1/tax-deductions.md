# Tax Deductions

Donors will have the option to receive a tax deduction for their donation. However, it is important to note that the tax deduction amount will be net of staking and protocol development fees as described in the [donation distribution](../donation-distribution.md) section.

The IHELP Foundation's fiscal sponsor,[ The Relief Foundation](https://therelieffoundation.org), will issue the tax deduction. The Relief Foundation is a registered 501(c)3 public charity. As IHELP's sponsor, it will receive and process the donations on its behalf. The IHELP Foundation is applying for its own 501(c)3 designation, a process that can take up to a year.&#x20;

IHELP is developing a module within the user dashboard to enable donors to claim their tax deduction.&#x20;
