# Introduction

###

The IHELP Foundation has been incorporated to serve the IHELP protocol. The Foundation will serve as a key piece of infrastructure for two main reasons: (i) it will serve as the main point of conversion of crypto donations to fiat when needed, and (ii) it will handle the delivery of donations to charities that do not have their own crypto wallets.&#x20;

The Foundation's mission will be to efficiently convert donations from crypto to fiat, and to get them in the hands of the donor's selected charity promptly.&#x20;

The IHELP ecosystem greatly benefits from the IHELP Foundation. Without it, the protocol would require that charities set up their own blockchain infrastructure, and that is less efficient than having a Foundation with all the required infrastructure. The protocol will scale out it's charity count much more quickly thanks to the IHELP Foundation.&#x20;

The Foundation's Board of Directors will be comprised of the co-founders of the IHELP Protocol. All of the Foundation's records will be available online for anyone to review at any time.&#x20;
