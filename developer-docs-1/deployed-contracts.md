# Introduction

###

The IHELP Foundation's purpose is to serve the IHELP protocol. The Foundation serves as a key piece of infrastructure for two reasons: (i) it acts as the main point of converting crypto donations to fiat when needed, and (ii) it handles the delivery of donations to charities that do not have crypto wallets.

The Foundation's mission is to efficiently convert donations from crypto to fiat and promptly get them in the donor's selected charity's hands.

The IHELP ecosystem greatly benefits from the IHELP Foundation. Without it, the protocol would require that charities set up their blockchain infrastructure, which is less efficient than having a Foundation with all the needed infrastructure. Thanks to the IHELP Foundation, the protocol can quickly scale out its charity count.

The Foundation's Board of Directors comprises the co-founders of the IHELP Protocol. All of the Foundation's records will be available online for anyone to review at any time.
