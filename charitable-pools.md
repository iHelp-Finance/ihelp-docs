# Charity Pools

The iHelp DAO will approve and on-board select charities to the protocol. In order to be considered, charities will have a form available to them that will request the following information: &#x20;

* Organization Name
* Brief Description & History
* Uses of Donated Funds&#x20;
* Countries of Operation
* Category
* Organization Logo
* Key Contact Person Name
* Key Contact Person Email
* Country of Incorporation&#x20;
* Tax ID number &#x20;
* Wallet Address (if available)

Approved charities will be assigned individual smart contracts and deployed on to the protocol by the iHelp DAO. Helpers are able to view, select, and contribute their capital to all approved charity pools. &#x20;

Once a Helper makes a contribution to their desired charity; the protocol will pool the allocated capital together and lend it out on a blue chip lending protocol such as Compound.The protocol will support contributions in multiple cryptocurrencies.&#x20;

When contributing capital to a charity pool, 80% of the accrued interest will be allocated to the charitable entities the Helpers selected. The remaining 20% of the accrued interest will be distributed 15% to a staking pool and 5% to the iHelp DAO treasury. Helpers can withdraw their allocated capital at any time. Helpers will be rewarded with iHelp tokens when contributing capital to charity pools.&#x20;

Should the Helper decide to donate principal directly to a charity via a direct donation, 95% of the donation will be allocated directly to the selected charity wallet address and the remaining 5% will be distributed evenly between staking pool rewards and the iHelp DAO treasury. Helpers will not be rewarded with iHelp tokens when donating directly to charities.\
