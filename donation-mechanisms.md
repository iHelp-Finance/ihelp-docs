# Donation Mechanisms

The protocol will allow people to practice sustainable donation of interest generated by their capital. In its initial form, The iHelp protocol will be a platform for people anywhere in the world to donate interest generated in leading lending protocols, such as Trader Joe (https://traderjoe.xyz) to specific charitable causes without experiencing principal loss. We seek to enable anyone willing to donate the time value of a specific amount of capital to participate sustainably in philanthropy towards meaningful causes.&#x20;

Users ("Helpers") can browse a list of charities and choose the causes they wish to support. The interest generated by this deposited capital will be donated to the charities. Helpers can withdraw or reallocate their capital at anytime.

The protocol will also allow users to donate principal directly to charities. We prefer capital to accumulate and donate accrued interest as this is a long-term sustainable win-win for both capital contributors (_“Helpers”_) and charitable organizations. However, in certain circumstances and emergencies, it may be most appropriate to also contribute principal directly to charities.
