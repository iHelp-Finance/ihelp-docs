# Donation Mechanisms

**Yield Donations**

Users ("Helpers") can browse a list of charities and choose the cause they wish to support. In order to successfully donate yield, a Helper must select (i) a charity, (ii) the ERC-20 token they wish to deposit, and (iii) the lending protocol they wish to employ for yield generation.

The protocol automatically distributes the yield to the IHELP Foundation, staking pool, and IHELP DAO Treasury according to the [Donation Distribution](donation-distribution.md) schedule. The IHELP Foundation receives and promptly processes the donation by converting it to fiat and forwarding the donation to the charitable cause.&#x20;

Helpers receive IHELP tokens as a reward for supporting charities via yield donations. Please refer to the IHELP Token section for more.&#x20;



**Direct Donations**

The protocol will also allow Helpers to donate directly to charities. We prefer capital to accumulate and donate accrued interest as this is a long-term sustainable win-win for Helpers and charitable organizations. However, in certain circumstances and emergencies, it may be most appropriate to also contribute principal directly to charities.

In order to donate directly, a Helper must simply select a charity and the crypto they wish to donate. The protocol automatically distributes the direct donation according to the [Donation Distribution](donation-distribution.md) schedule. The IHELP foundation will receive the donation in crypto, convert to fiat, and forward it to the charitable entity the Helper selected.&#x20;

Helpers that execute direct donations will not be rewarded with IHELP tokens. IHELP tokens will only be distributed to Yield Donors.&#x20;
