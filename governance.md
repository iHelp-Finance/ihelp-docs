# Governance

The IHELP Protocol is governed by the IHELP DAO. The IHELP DAO is temporarily controlled by a 3-3 multisig until the decentralized governance module is deployed (see [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for expected timing of deployment). IHELP DAO governance will be based on a voting escrow system pioneered by [CRV Finance](https://resources.curve.fi/governance/understanding-governance).&#x20;
