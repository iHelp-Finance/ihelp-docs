# Governance

The iHelp Protocol will be managed by the iHelp DAO. At its inception, the iHelp DAO will be governed by GHELP token holders. It is the iHelp’s DAO’s responsibility to add/archive charities, manage the iHelp treasury & vote on protocol upgrades. The protocol will be progressively decentralized in phases. The initial core governance infrastructure of The iHelp DAO will be via Gnosis Safe, Snapshot and SafeSnap.

IHELP token holders will be progressively empowered to govern the protocol. The community will first be empowered to manage the approval and archiving of charities in the protocol. In this initial governance phase, we will be looking to confirm that the platform, methods, and procedures chosen to govern work well and are suitable to inherit additional governance powers.&#x20;

In subsequent phases, the iHelp token holders will be further empowered to vote on the actions of the iHelp DAO treasury as well as decisions regarding contract upgrades. For example, iHelp token holders may vote to upgrade the Charity Pool contracts to allow charities to self-onboard, while retaining the right to archive any charity in the protocol.&#x20;

The ultimate goal is for iHelp to be a fully decentralized protocol governed by its community with the right tools and procedures.
